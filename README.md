CNC-Pantograph
==============

A pantograph for distributing power along a makerslide rail

A small experiment for a possible upcoming project. Is meant to be one part of a system that distributes power along an aluminum extrusion for CNC and robotics work. Think of it as a model train track, but with CNC stuff.
